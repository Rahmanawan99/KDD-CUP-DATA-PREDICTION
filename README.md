KDD Cup data prediction on ANN provided by Keras and Scikit

KDD cup GZ data has been converted to CSV and numerical values are hot-encoded already.

The unprocessed csv file is called all_data.csv 
Then I cleaned the data and saved it as cleaned_data.csv on array_duplicate_check to do it manually 

and finally after corellation matrix i droppped some columns and saved the final file for my model as cleaned_data_drop.csv (however categorical columns are yet to be encoded)

There are other .py files that were used to do some EDA however the main AI model is in model.ipynb
